Privacy Policy for Chat Alert Notification Chrome Extension
Last Updated: September 15, 2025

1. Overview
Chat Alert Notification is a Chrome extension that plays a sound alert when someone joins the Service Central chat on hormel.saasit.com. This policy explains how data is collected, used, and protected.

2. Information Collection
    The extension uses Chrome’s storage API to save user preferences within the browser (namely notification sound selection and whether the extension is enabled)
    The extension tracks which browser tab and window contains the Service Central chat, storing this locally to be able to focus the tab on alert.
    No personal, sensitive, or identifiable information is read, saved, or shared.
    The extension only runs scripts on pages within the hormel.saasit.com domain and cannot access data on other websites.

3. Use of Information
    Stored data is used strictly for the functionality of the extension.
    Data is stored locally in the user’s browser.
    The extension does not analyze, share, or sell any information.
    
4. Data Disclosure and Sharing
    No information is disclosed to or shared with third parties.
    Extension data never leaves the user’s local device.
    
6. User Controls
    Users may change their preferences at any time via the extension’s popup menu.
    Users may delete their data by removing the chrome extension from their browser.

7. Changes to This Policy
    Changes to this privacy policy will be posted on the Chrome Web Store listing and updated within the extension.
    Continued use of the extension implies acceptance of any changes.

8. Contact
    For questions or concerns about this policy, please use the Chat Alert Notification developer via the Chrome Web Store to reach out.
